## :bookmark: Summary

In `src/test/scala` :

- `TestScala` contains multiples tests to demonstrate the syntax,
- `calculus/TestComplex` test complex object to show off function
- `generator/TestStringCombination` test to show off all possibles string permutation from a size span and a char Seq.

## :satellite: How to run tests

__If you use Intellij Idea editor__:
1. Get the contextual menu of folder `src/test/scala` and select `Run ScalaTests in scala`

__If you use sbt__:
1. simply type `sbt test` or `sbt` then `test`:
    ```sbtshell
